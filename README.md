## Getting Started


A volumio UI focused on Tidal integration (and search) currently running via RestAPI and localhost

## Some limitations
* Currently only runs locally
* Needs a .env file with the Client ID and Client Secret from TIDAL

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID = "REPLACE"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET = "REPLACE"
